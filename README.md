# Smart_gloves
This project presents a communication solution for nonverbal individuals using smart gloves with four flex sensors on the fingers. The sensors detect bending through changes in resistance, converting finger movements into two-bit binary values. These values are combined into an eight-bit binary sequence, which is then translated into ASCII characters to form words and sentences. A microcontroller processes the sensor data, encodes it, and displays the resulting message on an LCD screen, enabling communication without the need for sign language knowledge.
